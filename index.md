## Motivation

Lobbying - trying to influence decision by the government, particularly legislators, plays a [major role in U.S. American politics](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/l/lobbying_and_lobbyists/index.html). One of the major players is the The National Rifle Association (NRA), an American nonprofit organization dedicated to protect the Second Amendment - the right to keep and bear arms. The NRA is opposed to any kind of gun regulation, including background checks, registration of fire arms, or restriction of assault weapon ownership, even though [the majority of US citizens supports stricter gun controls](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx). It exerts its political influence not only through ads (e.g., the most recent campaign against former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and his gun control efforts), but also financial contributions to political campaigns. 

The [app](http://noname.shinyapps.io/DataProducts) aims to visualize the amount and the number of individual financial contributions by the NRA in election years 2000 though 2014. It provides some background information on the total number and amount (in US$) of individual contributions across US states. The interactive plots allow users to select U.S. states and to plot NRA contributions (both number and amount). 

The data was compiled and published by the [National Institute on Money in State Politics](http://www.followthemoney.org/), and the [data](https://github.com/B00H/DataProducts) was downloaded on 11 Sept 2014.

## Why should you explore the app? 

To get an idea how much money the National Rifle Organization has been spending in election years 2000 to 2014 across all and in individual U.S. states. 

To get an idea why Michael Bloomberg is investing a (significant amount of his private fortune)[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/us/bloomberg-plans-a-50-million-challenge-to-the-nra.html?_r=0] to support gun control measures.

To ponder why the National Rifle Association has been spending so much more money in California than other U.S. States.
